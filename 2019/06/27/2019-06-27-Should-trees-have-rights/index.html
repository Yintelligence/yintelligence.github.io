                <h1 id="Should-trees-have-rights"><a href="#Should-trees-have-rights" class="headerlink" title="Should trees have rights?"></a>Should trees have rights?</h1><p><em>Kaidi Wang &amp; Chaoqun Yin</em></p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>In the legal tradition, we have generally treated nature as property and entrusted governments with its protection. We instructed agencies to manage natural resources and wildlife in public interest. But nowadays, with the increase of natural disasters such as global warming, drought, melting of the polar glaciers, climate change has attracted the attention around the world, which forces the governments to develop comprehensive regulations to response the challenges.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rights of nature have been focused and discussed in recent decades of years. In the widely cited and influential article, ‘Should Trees Have Standing?’, Christopher Stone argued for conferring legal personality and rights on the environment because, as a rights-holder, the natural object would “have a legally recognized worth and dignity in its own right, and not merely to serve as a means to benefit ‘us’….”.</p>
<p>Legal recognition of nature or some part of the natural world as having legal personality can be seen emerging in various doctrines and developments around the world. The historical concept of public trust has been expanded to make the natural world or parts of it the beneficiary of protection, while various “rights of nature” have been incorporated into the constitutions of several countries.</p>
<h2 id="The-history-of-the-rights-of-nature-paradigm"><a href="#The-history-of-the-rights-of-nature-paradigm" class="headerlink" title="The history of the rights of nature paradigm"></a>The history of the rights of nature paradigm</h2><p>The idea of granting Nature legal rights originated in a court case decided in 1972 by the United States Supreme Court, <em>Sierra Club versus Morton</em>. Based on this case, Christopher Stone, a professor at the University of California School of Law, authored a law review article arguing that natural areas and objects should have legal rights to defend their ecological integrity from harms that would damage them. The article, named as “Should trees have rights” caught attention of Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, who said, “Contemporary public concern for protecting nature’s ecological equilibrium should lead to the conferral of standing upon environmental objects to sue for their own preservation.”</p>
<p>The country of Ecuador was the first to place Rights of Nature in its governing laws. Section 7 of the new Constitution of Ecuador adopted in 2008 says, “Nature, or Pacha Mama, where life is reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes.”</p>
<p>Bolivia subsequently, in 2010, enacted a comprehensive Rights of Nature statute, and also hosted an international gathering of concerned organizations from around the world, which led to the founding of the Global Alliance for the Rights of Nature.</p>
<p>Other recent efforts include a state court in India granting legal personhood to the heavily polluted Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, and local Rights of Nature legislation in various regions of the United States. Most recently (in February 2019), the people of Toledo, Ohio passed a Bill of Community Rights and Nature’s Rights to protect Lake Erie, subject to nearly annual toxic algal blooms, mainly as a result of industrial agricultural practices in the lake’s watershed. </p>
<p>Rights of Nature is less a specific template than an overarching ideal of ecological governance, the details of which are fashioned in unique ways in each culture that is seeking to enhance or restore sustainable living within Nature’s limits. This requires that Nature be granted the same rights to flourish and maintain itself as humans grant themselves in their legal structures. But underlying the need for legal protections is the concept that humans and Nature are in a relationship, rather than Nature merely providing a hoard of natural resources for indiscriminate human use. The legal structures discussed in Rights of Nature literature codifies the details of this restored relationship, rather than creating it. </p>
<h2 id="Should-trees-have-rights？"><a href="#Should-trees-have-rights？" class="headerlink" title="Should trees have rights？"></a>Should trees have rights？</h2><h3 id="Subjects-of-law"><a href="#Subjects-of-law" class="headerlink" title="Subjects of law"></a>Subjects of law</h3><p>As the “Declaration of tree rights” which was adopted in a meeting room of the French National Assembly in Paris said, “A tree should be considered as a subject of law, including when laws regarding human property are involved.” </p>
<p>The concept of nature’s rights and legal personality has been proposed in a variety of formulations, from legally enforceable rights, to “biotic rights” as moral imperatives, to human responsibilities and duties towards nature. Giving legal recognition to the intrinsic value of nature, by adding new “subjects” of law, is one far-reaching proposal. Some argue that this has already occurred while others object that the ascription of rights to nature anthropomorphizes it to its detriment. Still others view rights-conferring as one tool to enhance the value of nature.</p>
<p>When the trees are given “legal personality” and become “personhood” in the law system, the first question that must be considered is the scope of granting legal person status to trees. Should all the trees become the subject of law or just a part of trees? If we only focus on some of trees that are thought to be precious and valuable such as endangered species and rare plants and give them rights to spend their whole life. Here, let us think them as extra value. Then in this case, it is unfair to the common trees. Why cannot the trees near my house get the right and why do they have lower status in the low, only because they are too extraordinary and can’t do contributions to biodiversity? In fact, they all produce oxygen and energy and reduce carbon dioxide, do the same to improve the environment. What about another group of trees, which are mainly used for timber purposes and as a source of sustenance: food, sugars, fatty oils and vegetable fats, bioenergy or biofuel<sup>[3]</sup>? If we never treat all the trees as same status, we should not easily decide the rights for them.</p>
<h3 id="Rights-and-obligations"><a href="#Rights-and-obligations" class="headerlink" title="Rights and obligations"></a>Rights and obligations</h3><p>Secondly, according to the definition of a legal or “juridical” person refers generally to an entity that is not a human being, but one on which society has decided to confer specific rights and obligations.</p>
<p>As is mentioned before, Bolivia passed constitutional amendment that gives nature equal rights to humans in 2009 and established new rights for nature and grants it comprehensive legal rights that are comparable to human rights in 2012. The rights include: the right to life and to exist; the right to continue vital cycles and processes free from human alteration; the right to pure water and clean air; the right to ecological balance; the right to the effective and opportune restoration of life systems affected by direct or indirect human activities, and the right for preservation of Mother Earth and any of its components with regards to toxic and radioactive waste generated by human activities.</p>
<p>But if we observe these rights, we can easily find that these rights are the instinct of trees, they will be born to do so, we don’t need to re-grant them these rights at all. Similarly, with the existing environmental protection laws, strengthening the protection of trees can also let the trees grow healthily do the same thing simply.</p>
<p>French recently declared that a tree “should be respected throughout its life and have the right to develop and to reproduce freely, from its birth to its natural death, whether it be a town tree or a country tree.” </p>
<p>Previous research and the law are more focus on the rights of nature or trees, as opposed to the obligations. But from the perspective of the legal person system, “A legal person in legal context typically is a person (or less ambiguously, a legal entity)—whether human or non-human—that is recognized as having certain privileges and obligations such as the legal capacity to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.” (from Wikipedia) Rights and obligations are closely linked. How do these trees fulfil their obligations and what are the obligations that must be obeyed? Obviously, it is hard for us to let the trees fulfil obligations. </p>
<p>Furthermore, trees are a group of the voiceless, so how do we protect their rights from infringement? What rights should a tree have? What happens when a tree infringes on the rights of another tree or a property? </p>
<h3 id="The-idea-of-guardship"><a href="#The-idea-of-guardship" class="headerlink" title="The idea of guardship"></a>The idea of guardship</h3><p>“Stone advocates the idea of guardship as the best way to protect their interests, as well as the best the ways to protect the global commons.”  In 2017, parliament passed a historic bill to recognize the special relationship between the Whanganui River and Whanganui iwi. Conferring legal personality on the Wanganui River or any other part of nature should allow legal action to be brought in the name of the person through a litigation guardian, or “guardian ad litem”.</p>
<p>As is discussed in Stone’s essay, the problem of how to choose the right guardian for the objects, and how to resolve conflicts that may between them. For the first problem, the court needs to entrust the related departments, organizations or individuals as the regulator to give a voice to the voiceless. Here, do we treat forest in a whole, or just focus on the specific objects within it? When it comes to cash crops, if we should be different? They have the same rights to live their life but in fact, we can never treat them legally. </p>
<p>Moreover, if the rights of trees are invaded, what kind of measurements should be done as a punishment? Fine them or do social work to make up for their mistakes? After all, all the measures are just remediation, we have not fundamentally solved the problem, so it is meaningless to give the trees rights or not. On the contrary, what if the trees do not fulfil the so-called obligations which are not so clear now or invade others’ right? The only way is to give the guardians or legal representative administrative punishment. But the original purpose of guardianship system is to protect the trees’ right, now how should we explain the legal effect of guardship?</p>
<p>Let us come back to guardship system for the trees. Landowners have custody of trees in their field, government departments have jurisdiction over trees on the street and state has the right to protect the forests. But it is impossible to arrange guardians for each tree and to define the scope of the guardian’s power.</p>
<p>Considering all the facts, the existing system is not enough to support the problems that will be faced in the future. For the rights of trees and the qualifications of legal persons, once the existing laws are expanded, it is difficult to predict whether they will conflict with existing laws.</p>
<h2 id="Trees-and-humans"><a href="#Trees-and-humans" class="headerlink" title="Trees and humans"></a>Trees and humans</h2><p>All kinds of trees have an incalculable role in maintaining ecological balance and biodiversity. All trees should be fully protected in principle, the concept of protecting endangered species should be abandoned, and the concept of comprehensive protection and all-round protection should be adhered to protect both species diversity and ecological diversity and genetic diversity.</p>
<p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is widely recognized as the most authoritative global assessment of the conservation status of species. Currently, more than 9,500 trees have been assessed and published on the IUCN Red List, over 6,400 of which are assessed as globally threatened (CR, EN, VU). Over 1,100 trees are assessed as Critically Endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List and in urgent need of conservation action. If trees are endowed with rights, are protected species more precious than ordinary trees?</p>
<p>It is derived from the concept of “species protection”, that is, to prevent the extinction of species by human or natural factors, to evaluate and confirm “precious and endangered” species through specific procedures, and then to strengthen key prevention and protection to achieve the sustainability of such species. However, “The INCU Red List” is a utilitarian concept. The classification of protected trees should not be based on whether are useful to human or quantitatively endangered. The definition of “Red List” artificially promotes the reproduction and development of specific species, but it also destroys the integrity and unity of the ecological environment, and the “valuable theory” of species has emerged. This creates a “separation” of “endangered” and “ordinary” species.</p>
<p>In the case of limited administrative resources, it is necessary to form a comprehensive protection system, and establish a certain priority protection system according to the priorities of the matter, so as to achieve the priority and priority protection of “precious and endangered” species. If each tree is given rights, they should be treated equally, which is obviously unrealistic to provide enough resources in the current stage of social development.</p>
<h3 id="Cash-Crop"><a href="#Cash-Crop" class="headerlink" title="Cash Crop"></a>Cash Crop</h3><p>A cash crop or profit crop is an agricultural crop which is grown to sell for profit. As a natural resource, trees have been exploited and exploited for thousands of years. Many farmers make a living by planting cash crops and carrying out related production and management. If trees are granted with rights, these behaviours should be abolished. The survival and employment transformation of these people will become a big problem which will not conducive to social stability. </p>
<h3 id="Trees-and-human-beings"><a href="#Trees-and-human-beings" class="headerlink" title="Trees and human beings"></a>Trees and human beings</h3><p>The law is made by people and it is difficult to avoid consideration of human interests. If trees are given rights, they are the same rights as human beings, and humans have no reason to develop trees. While trees and their fruits are important sources of human food, it seems that giving trees rights is unrealistic. In the ancient Chinese civilization, the profound philosophical thoughts of “Heaven and Man are one” are sometimes simply used to illustrate a harmonious state of human and natural environment, including trees, which is the goal pursued by world civilization.</p>
<p>In Europe, tree protection and welfare issues are deeply rooted in legislation and education, some of which go even to extremes.</p>
<p>In China, with the environmental damage and serious pollution, the public’s awareness of environmental protection has increased in recent years, but the understanding of the protection of trees still needs to be further improved.</p>
<h2 id="Conferring-rights-of-trees-can-really-protect-trees"><a href="#Conferring-rights-of-trees-can-really-protect-trees" class="headerlink" title="Conferring rights of trees can really protect trees?"></a>Conferring rights of trees can really protect trees?</h2><p>Sustainable development is a topic of common concern to the world today. Whether it is by law giving trees rights or establishing a guardian system, no matter what form of measures are taken, the final objective is to reduce the damage to the nature and protect the forests, urge people to make good use of resources and protect the natural environment and ecosystems, and try to keep a beautiful home for the next generation.</p>
<p>Conferring rights of trees can really protect the interests of trees? As a matter of fact, we are defending our own interests and the benefits of the next generation. Since then, why do we protect our own interests in the name of protecting the rights of trees?</p>
<p>First, we never treat all trees equally. We cannot deny the precious species and the natural forest are far more important than the trees on the road or behind the house in our subconscious. In fact, we do treat them like this, that is, what is the meaning of giving trees rights?</p>
<p>Secondly, we never treat trees as “real persons”. Whether the trees or animals, or anything else except human being themselves., all what we have done and what we will do is to maintain our own interests. We obtain food and trees, we cut down trees to build houses and furniture. And now how do we give them rights to live a whole life.</p>
<p>Finally, what we are talking about here is to grant the trees rights to let them live their whole life, that is, people should not deliberately destroy and cut down trees, in another word, trees should be protected. Then the question is converted to the landowners’ duties and whether some or all trees are protected and how such protections are given force. Based on this, it is difficult to define how much everyone’s duty is and how much protection should be given to the trees in law. </p>
<p>Protection of trees can be ensured within the human right in the environment. But as to the recognition of rights to the tree, what is the benefit behind it? Can it really protect the trees? Nobody can answer the question, but what we can be sure of is that if trees are granted legal personality and rights, this will undoubtedly challenge the existing legal system and add a series of troubles.</p>
<p>Compared to giving trees rights., human protection seems to be  a simpler and more effective means.</p>
